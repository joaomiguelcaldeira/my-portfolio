# Project 1 Author João Caldeira
This project is a program made in C++ to predict the grade of a student’s project based on the grade of the student’s test by also knowing that students frequently exchange project solutions between them. This solution uses a graph to describe the relations between students, and uses a DFS to search for the highest grade in a circle of friends and apply it’s spread between them. This is the same as searching for the strongly connected components in the graph and searching for the highest grade in each SCC to get the best prediction of the students grades.
